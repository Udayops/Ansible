Ansible Installation

Ansible is an open-source automation platform. It is very, very simple to set up and yet powerful. Ansible can help you with configuration management, application deployment, task automation.
Pre-requisites

    An AWS EC2 instance (on Control node)
good to go
Installation steps:
on Amazon EC2 instance

    Install python and python-pip

    yum install python
    yum install python-pip

    Install ansible using pip check for version

    pip install ansible
    ansible --version

    Create a user called ansible (on Control node and Managed host)

    useradd ansible
    passwd ansible

    Below command grant sudo access to ansible user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. (on Control node and Managed host)

    x   

    Log in as a ansible user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)

    ssh-keygen

    Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
    
    ssh-copy-id ansible@<target-server>

    Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansible to the docker group.

    yum install docker

    # start docker services 
    service docker start
    service docker start 

    # add user to docker group 
    usermod -aG docker ansible

    Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it.

Validation test

    Run ansible command as ansible user it should be successful (Master)

    ansible all -m ping
    
    
    LAB WORK
    
        CONTROL NODE
    1) python --version
    2) yum update
    3) sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel
    4) yum repolist
    5) yum install ansible
    6) sudo amazon-linux-extras install ansible2
    7) ansible --version
    8) vim /etc/ansible/hosts  #add all the managed hosts
    9) useradd ansible
    10) passwd ansible # Switch to ansible user
    11) ssh-keygen
    
    MANAGED NODE
    1) useradd ansible
    2) passwd ansible
    3) vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    4) set password authentication as yes
    5) systemctl restart sshd.service
    
    CONTROL NODE
    1) yum repolist
    2)  yum list sshpass
    3)  amazon-linux-extras list sshpass
    4)  amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
    5) echo $?
    6) sudo yum install sshpass
    7) ssh-copy-id ansible@54.167.88.18 #do this for all the managed node
    8) ansible all -m ping
